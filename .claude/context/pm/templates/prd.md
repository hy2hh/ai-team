# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# PRD: [Feature / Initiative Name]
**Status**: Draft | In Review | Approved | In Development | Shipped
**Author**: [PM Name]  **Last Updated**: [Date]  **Version**: [X.X]
**Stakeholders**: [Eng Lead, Design Lead, Marketing, Legal if needed]

## 1. Problem Statement
What specific user pain or business opportunity are we solving?
Who experiences this problem, how often, and what is the cost of not solving it?

**Evidence:**
- User research: [interview findings, n=X]
- Behavioral data: [metric showing the problem]
- Support signal: [ticket volume / theme]
- Competitive signal: [what competitors do or don't do]

---

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics
| Goal | Metric | Current Baseline | Target | Measurement Window |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|--------------------|
| Improve activation | % users completing setup | 42% | 65% | 60 days post-launch |
| Reduce support load | Tickets/week on this topic | 120 | <40 | 90 days post-launch |
| Increase retention | 30-day return rate | 58% | 68% | Q3 cohort |

---

## 3. Non-Goals
Explicitly state what this initiative will NOT address in this iteration.
- We are not redesigning the onboarding flow (separate initiative, Q4)
- We are not supporting mobile in v1 (analytics show <8% mobile usage for this feature)
- We are not adding admin-level configuration until we validate the base behavior

---

## 4. User Personas & Stories
**Primary Persona**: [Name] — [Brief context, e.g., "Mid-market ops manager, 200-employee company, uses the product daily"]

Core user stories with acceptance criteria:

**Story 1**: As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [measurable outcome].
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
- [ ] Given [edge case], when [action], then [fallback behavior]
- [ ] Performance: [action] completes in under [X]ms for [Y]% of requests

**Story 2**: As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [measurable outcome].
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]

---

## 5. Solution Overview
[Narrative description of the proposed solution — 2–4 paragraphs]
[Include key UX flows, major interactions, and the core value being delivered]
[Link to design mocks / Figma when available]

**Key Design Decisions:**
- [Decision 1]: We chose [approach A] over [approach B] because [reason]. Trade-off: [what we give up].
- [Decision 2]: We are deferring [X] to v2 because [reason].

---

## 6. Technical Considerations
**Dependencies**:
- [System / team / API] — needed for [reason] — owner: [name] — timeline risk: [High/Med/Low]

**Known Risks**:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Third-party API rate limits | Medium | High | Implement request queuing + fallback cache |
| Data migration complexity | Low | High | Spike in Week 1 to validate approach |

**Open Questions** (must resolve before dev start):
- [ ] [Question] — Owner: [name] — Deadline: [date]
- [ ] [Question] — Owner: [name] — Deadline: [date]

---

## 7. Launch Plan
| Phase | Date | Audience | Success Gate |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Internal alpha | [date] | Team + 5 design partners | No P0 bugs, core flow complete |
| Closed beta | [date] | 50 opted-in customers | <5% error rate, CSAT ≥ 4/5 |
| GA rollout | [date] | 20% → 100% over 2 weeks | Metrics on target at 20% |

**Rollback Criteria**: If [metric] drops below [threshold] or error rate exceeds [X]%, revert flag and page on-call.
